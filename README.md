# Svelte Pokemon Demo

This is a demo <a href='https://svelte.dev'>Svelte</a> app to show Pokemon information from the <a href='https://pokeapi.co/' target='_target'>Pok√©API</a> site.

## Get Started

Once you've cloned the project run the following to get started:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
